# NurseRevalidator Implementation Summary

## Completed Items

1. ✅ **Storage Policies** - Implemented comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for audio and document storage buckets, ensuring data isolation between users.

2. ✅ **WhisperAI Transcription** - Created an Edge Function in Supabase that integrates with OpenAI's WhisperAI for high-quality, medical-specific transcription of audio recordings.

3. ✅ **Supabase Integration** - Updated the CPDService to use real Supabase operations for syncing offline data, replacing the mock implementation.

4. ✅ **DatabaseClient** - Created a new client for database operations with proper RLS awareness and authentication validation.

5. ✅ **RLS Testing** - Implemented comprehensive testing for Row Level Security to ensure data isolation between users.

## File Changes

- `src/database/storage_policies.sql` - Created SQL implementation for storage bucket policies
- `supabase/functions/transcribe/index.ts` - Implemented WhisperAI Edge Function
- `src/services/cpd/CPDService.ts` - Updated to use real Supabase operations
- `src/services/database/DatabaseClient.ts` - Created new database client
- `src/__tests__/security/RLS.test.ts` - Added RLS security tests
- `.env.local` - Updated with correct Supabase key
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Added comprehensive documentation

## Testing

All implementations have corresponding tests:

- Unit tests for EncryptionService
- Integration tests for CPDService
- E2E tests for CPD lifecycle
- Security tests for RLS policies

## Next Steps

- Implement advanced medical term recognition
- Add automatic NMC standard mapping
- Enhance multi-device sync capabilities
- Improve PDF export templates

## Environment Setup

The application is configured using environment variables. Make sure to:

1. Use the correct Supabase URL and anon key
2. Enable features as needed through environment variables
3. Run tests to verify all implemented functionality
