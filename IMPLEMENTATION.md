# NurseRevalidator Implementation Documentation

## Recently Implemented Features

### 1. Storage Policies

Secure Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been implemented for all storage buckets to ensure data isolation between users. The policies use the user's authenticated ID to control access permissions.

**Key implementations:**

- Audio bucket policies to restrict access to each user's audio recordings
- Document bucket policies for secure PDF storage and retrieval
- Database-level RLS policies for the CPD entries table

**Location:** `src/database/storage_policies.sql`

### 2. WhisperAI Transcription Integration

A complete integration with OpenAI's WhisperAI has been implemented as an Edge Function in Supabase. This provides high-quality, medical-specific transcription of audio recordings.

**Key features:**

- Medical terminology enhancement using common nursing terms
- Secure audio file handling via signed URLs
- Persistent storage of transcription results
- Integration with the CPD entry system

**Location:** `supabase/functions/transcribe/index.ts`

### 3. Real Supabase Integration for Sync

The CPD service has been updated to use real Supabase operations for syncing offline data, replacing the mock implementation. This includes:

**Key features:**

- Intelligent conflict resolution for offline changes
- Proper error handling and reporting
- Status tracking for sync operations
- Efficient bulk operations for performance

**Location:** `src/services/cpd/CPDService.ts`

### 4. Database Client with RLS Awareness

A new DatabaseClient class has been created to centralize all database operations with proper RLS awareness.

**Key features:**

- Authentication validation for all operations
- Proper error handling and typing
- Consistent timestamp management
- Support for all CRUD operations on CPD entries and transcriptions

**Location:** `src/services/database/DatabaseClient.ts`

### 5. RLS Security Testing

Comprehensive testing for Row Level Security has been implemented to ensure data isolation between users.

**Key tests:**

- Verification that users cannot access other users' CPD entries
- Storage policy testing for file access restrictions
- Validation of database-level security policies

**Location:** `src/__tests__/security/RLS.test.ts`

## Environment Setup

The application uses environment variables for configuration with proper validation. To set up the environment:

1. Copy `.env.local` to a new file called `.env.local` in the root directory
2. Set the Supabase URL and anon key
3. Configure feature flags as needed:
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FEATURE_PDF_EXPORT=true`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FEATURE_VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION=true`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FEATURE_OFFLINE_MODE=true`
4. Enable security features:
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true`

## Next Steps

The following features are planned for future implementation:

1. **Enhanced Medical Term Recognition** - Improve transcription accuracy with a larger medical terminology database
2. **Automatic NMC Standard Mapping** - Link CPD entries to relevant NMC standards automatically
3. **Multi-device Sync** - Improve the sync algorithm to handle multiple devices for the same user
4. **Advanced PDF Templates** - Add more customization options for PDF exports
